# Architecture

This document explains how Dark Alpha provides privacy-preserving prediction markets on Solana.

## Overview

Dark Alpha has three main components:

1. DAC Token Program - An Anchor program that wraps USDC into encrypted confidential tokens
2. Web Frontend - A Next.js app where users interact with markets
3. API Backend - An Express server that handles market operations and privacy services

## Privacy Layer

### The Problem

In standard prediction markets, every bet is publicly visible on-chain. If you place a large bet, other traders see it immediately and can:
- Front-run your order
- Copy your strategy
- Move the price against you before you finish trading

### The Solution

Dark Alpha uses Inco Network's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt bet amounts on-chain. Here's how it works:

1. User wants to bet 1000 USDC on YES
2. The 1000 USDC is wrapped into DAC (Dark Alpha Confidential) tokens
3. The DAC balance is stored as an encrypted handle on-chain
4. The bet is placed using DAC tokens
5. Other traders see that a bet occurred but cannot see the amount
6. When the market resolves, DAC is unwrapped back to USDC

## DAC Token Program

The DAC token is a custom SPL token built with Anchor that integrates with Inco Lightning for FHE operations.

### Accounts

**DacMint** - The mint authority for DAC tokens
- Stores the USDC mint it wraps
- Tracks total supply (encrypted)
- Controls the vault that holds USDC collateral

**DacAccount** - A user's DAC token account
- Stores encrypted balance as a handle (128-bit ciphertext reference)
- Linked to the user's public key
- Can only be decrypted by the owner

**Vault** - Holds the USDC collateral
- PDA controlled by the DAC program
- 1:1 backing - every DAC is backed by USDC in the vault

### Instructions

**deposit** - Wrap USDC to DAC
- Transfers USDC from user to vault
- Encrypts amount via Inco Lightning
- Adds encrypted amount to user's balance handle

**withdraw** - Unwrap DAC to USDC
- Decrypts user's balance (requires proof from Inco co-validator)
- Transfers USDC from vault to user
- Updates encrypted balance handle

**transfer** - Send DAC between accounts
- Subtracts from sender's encrypted balance
- Adds to receiver's encrypted balance
- Amount stays encrypted throughout

### Program Addresses

| Component | Address |
|-----------|---------|
| DAC Program | `ByaYNFzb2fPCkWLJCMEY4tdrfNqEAKAPJB3kDX86W5Rq` |
| DAC SPL Mint | `JBxiN5BBM8ottNaUUpWw6EFtpMRd6iTnmLYrhZB5ArMo` |
| Mint Authority PDA | `TtFoW2UtEqkVGiGtbwwnzMxyGk1JyneqeNGiZEhcDRJ` |

## Inco Integration

Inco Network provides the FHE infrastructure. We use two components:

### Inco Lightning Program
Address: `5sjEbPiqgZrYwR31ahR6Uk9wf5awoX61YGg7jExQSwaj`

This on-chain program handles:
- Creating encrypted values (CPI from DAC program)
- Arithmetic on encrypted values (add, subtract)
- Comparison operations (for balance checks)

### Inco Co-Validator
Endpoint: `https://grpc.solana-devnet.alpha.devnet.inco.org`

This off-chain service handles:
- Decryption requests (when users want to withdraw)
- Signature verification (proves the requester owns the data)
- Returns signed plaintext that can be verified on-chain

## Dark Markets

Dark Markets are prediction markets that use DAC as collateral instead of USDC.

### How They Differ from Regular Markets

| Aspect | Regular Market | Dark Market |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Collateral | USDC | DAC (encrypted) |
| Bet visibility | Public | Hidden |
| Position sizes | Anyone can see | Only owner knows |
| Market odds | Public | Public |

### User Flow

1. User has USDC in their wallet
2. User clicks "Bet YES" on a Dark Market
3. Behind the scenes:
   - USDC is wrapped to DAC (automatic)
   - DAC is used to buy YES tokens
   - The amount is encrypted
4. Other users see aggregate volume but not individual bets
5. When market resolves:
   - Winning DAC is unwrapped to USDC
   - User receives USDC directly

The user only needs to think about USDC. The DAC wrapping is abstracted away.

```

### Key Flows

**Connecting Wallet**
- Uses @phantom/react-sdk for multi-chain support
- Fetches SOL, USDC, and DAC balances on connect
- DAC balance shown as encrypted handle (actual value hidden)

**Placing a Bet**
1. User selects market and amount
2. Frontend calls `/api/dark-markets/prepare-bet`
3. Server returns unsigned transaction
4. User signs with Phantom
5. Frontend submits signed transaction
6. Server broadcasts to Solana

**Viewing Positions**
- Positions stored in privacy-preserving order book
- User sees their own positions with commitment hashes
- Public view shows aggregate statistics only

```

### Client-Side Signing

The server never holds user private keys. The flow is:

1. Client requests unsigned transaction from server
2. Server builds transaction with correct accounts and data
3. Server returns base64-encoded transaction
4. Client deserializes and signs with Phantom
5. Client submits signed transaction
6. Server broadcasts to network

This keeps user funds secure even if the server is compromised.

## PNP Integration

PNP Protocol provides the prediction market infrastructure. We use:

- `PNPClient` - SDK for market operations
- `fetchMarkets()` - Get all markets
- `fetchMarket(address)` - Get specific market
- `createMarket()` - Create new market with custom collateral
- `buyTokensUsdc()` - Purchase YES/NO tokens

For Dark Markets, we specify DAC mint as the `baseMint` parameter when creating markets.

## AI Agent

The AI agent scans news sources and creates prediction markets automatically.

### News Sources
- CoinDesk RSS
- CoinTelegraph
- Custom feeds

### Market Generation
1. Agent fetches recent news
2. Google Gemini analyzes for prediction-worthy events
3. Agent formats as yes/no question
4. Market created via PNP SDK

### Configuration
- Runs on scheduled intervals
- Can be triggered manually via API
- Markets tagged as "Dark Alpha" for tracking

## Security Considerations

**Private Key Handling**
- Server private key used only for market creation
- User private keys never touch the server
- All user trades are client-signed

**Encryption**
- FHE handles encrypted arithmetic
- Decryption requires co-validator signature
- Balance handles are 128-bit ciphertext references

**On-Chain Security**
- DAC program checks all authority signatures
- Vault controlled by PDA (not externally owned account)
- USDC fully collateralized at all times

## Limitations

**Current Constraints**
- Running on devnet only
- DAC program not audited
- Inco integration uses alpha co-validator endpoint
- PNP SDK limits transaction building flexibility

**Future Work**
- Mainnet deployment with audited contracts
- Full Inco SDK integration for decryption
- MEV protection for transaction submission
- Batch transaction support for multiple bets
